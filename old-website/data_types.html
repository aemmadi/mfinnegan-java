        <h1><b><div id="main">Data Types</b></h1>
        To make variables in Java, they need a data type. A data type tells the Java compiler what kind of data a variable is.</div>

        <h2><b>Integers</b></h2>
        To declare integer variables:
		<pre class ="code">int a = 0;</pre>
        If you want to change the value of a variable:
		<pre class ="code">a = 20;</pre>
        The "int" primitive type can only store integers. The following would not work: 
        <pre class ="code">a = 5.6;</pre>
        <hr>
        <h2><b>Decimals</b></h2>
        To declare variables that store decimals : 
        <pre class ="code">double d = 4.5; </pre>
        The following code will output 4 : <br>
        <pre class ="code">System.out.println(4.0);</pre>
        Another way to declare decimals is to use "float" : 
        <pre class ="code">float f = 4.5f;</pre>
        Floats must have an "f" letter at the end of the decimal.
        <hr>
        <h2><b>Strings</b></h2>
        To store a series of characters in a variable, use "String" data type : 
        <pre class ="code">String sentence = "hello world"; </pre>
         Strings are made up of characters, so you can access each of their characters through their index. Indexes always start at 0. The following code will print "h":
        <pre class ="code">System.out.println(sentence.charAt(0));</pre>
        When 2 or more strings are added together, that is called "Concatenation" : 
        <pre class ="code">String word1 = "hello";</pre>
        <pre class ="code">String word2 = "world";</pre>
        <pre class ="code">String sentence = word1 + word2;</pre> </p>
